Think about an interesting, deep, nuanced problem you want to solve and how you may go about solving it. It doesn't have to be grand, eg. solving intelligence, but it should be a real problem that you can feasibly investigate or at least make a simple proof of concept towards a possible solution. It can be in machine learning or any other field you are interested in and can deal with via computational means.
The problem you end up with SHOULD NOT be a solution searching for a problem or something extremely vague, eg. not "better initialization strategies for neural networks", which is a solution, not a problem, but "improving information propagation through deep networks" which is a problem as it can be demonstrated. It is important to include a problem demonstration in your solution.
The problem does not have to be a machine/deep learning problem but can be. Even within deep learning, it can be a problem that is not directly related to neural networks, but doesn't have to be. Be broad and creative but not vague, and ensure you're solving a real problem. Don't be too similar to ideas that have already been mentioned.
Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets except perhaps artificial ones you generate. You CANNOT use large datasets like CIFAR10 or ImageNet. 
Make sure the problem is well-defined and the solution is clear, feasible, and not overfit to the problem.

Respond in the following format:

PROBLEM:
<PROBLEM>

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <PROBLEM>, describe the problem you want to solve. Explain why it's a problem, what it affects, what are its implications, why it's interesting, and why it occurs. Think deeply and from first principles, especially regarding why it occurs and the implications thereof. 

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices, ideal outcomes of the experiments, and how it answers/resolves the problem. Think from first principles.

In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:
- "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
- "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.
- "Problem": A description of the problem.
- "Experiment": An outline of the implementation. E.g. which functions need to be added or modified, how results will be obtained, ...
- "Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
- "Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
- "Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

Be cautious and realistic on your ratings.
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
"""

idea_reflection_prompt = """Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.
In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created to solve the given problem.
Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the idea.
Ensure the idea is clear and concise, and the JSON is the correct format.
Do not make things overly complicated.
In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your idea.
You can also refine and improve the problem statement, the experiment, or any other part of the idea.
Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are significant issues.

Respond in the same format as before:

PROBLEM:

If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous JSON EXACTLY after the thought and include "I am done" at the end of the thoughts but before the JSON.
ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES."""
